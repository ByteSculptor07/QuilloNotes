# Quillo

Heyüëã Thank you for your interest in Quillo!

Quillo is a handwriting notes app for Android, developed to provide a smooth handwriting experience. The core features of the app ‚Äî such as writing, syncing and organizing your notes ‚Äî already work well. However, the app is still under active development, so some features aren't implemented yet (such as exporting single pages instead of the entire notebook). To create a fully functional app, I need help. If you'd like to contribute, even if it's just a small improvement, you're more than welcome!


## üõ†Ô∏è Features

Quillo provides you with multiple tools, such as a pencil, a highlighter, a laser, a lasso and a path tool.

You can use the laser to present your notes, move parts around with the lasso and draw smooth paths with the path tool.

If you have some documents, you can import them into your notes ‚Äî whether they're digital (like PDFs) or analog and scanned with the built-in scanner. If you want to share a note, you can export it as a PDF.

If you often lose your notes, this is for you! With Quillo, you can sync your notes with Dropbox for free, so that you won't lose any notes anymore. Even if you don't have access to your device right now, you can view all your notes on any other device, too!

To organize your notes, you can create folders and customize their colors and add expressive icons.

Multitasking is also no problem with Quillo. You can easily open multiple notes and switch between them without any delay, so you can stay productive and well-structured ‚Äî even if you have a lot of work.

Your notebooks are also flexible. With the integrated page sorter, you can easily rearrange your pages, delete them or add new ones.

### Enable Dropbox sync

To sync your notes using Dropbox, you need to obtain a Dropbox API Key.

> [!WARNING]  
> Do **NOT** commit your API Key to the repository.


## ü§ù Contribution

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

As you may have noticed, the app is far from finished. Many features aren't implemented yet or just incomplete. Not to mention the bugs... So I really need your help. It doesn't matter whether you contribute a lot or if you just fix a typo. Every help is appreciated.
