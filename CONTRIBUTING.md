# Ways to Contribute
There are many ways you can contribute:
- **Testing the app:** You can test the app and report bugs or suggest new features
- **Contribute with code:** You can browse the [issues](https://github.com/ByteSculptor07/QuilloNotes/issues) and find an issue that matches your interest. There are also [good first issues](https://github.com/ByteSculptor07/QuilloNotes/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) that you can check out!
- **UI/UX design:** If you have any suggestions to improve usability or design of the app, your ideas are very welcome!
- **Anything else:** Probably I haven't listed everything here, so if you want to contribute in any other way, feel free to open a discussion or an issue

All contributions are very helpful, no matter how small they are. Thank you!
